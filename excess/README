Tukvnanawopi Game Programs

This repository contains three programs for playing and managing games of Tukvnanawopi: tplay, tmovecheck, and td.pl.
Programs
1. tplay

tplay is an executable that implements a random Tukvnanawopi player. It is invoked with the following syntax:

./tplay file player

    file: The name of a file that contains the board configuration.
    player: Either B or W, indicating which player the agent should assume.

Examples:

./tplay tsample1 B
./tplay tsample2 W
./tplay tsample3 B

2. tmovecheck

tmovecheck is a utility that checks if a given move is correct on a certain board configuration. It is used by the driver script.

3. td.pl

td.pl is a Perl script that drives a game between two players. It is invoked with the following syntax:

./td.pl blackplayer whiteplayer

    blackplayer: The executable for the first player.
    whiteplayer: The executable for the second player.

Example:

./td.pl tplay tplay

This command will play a full game of the random player against a "clone" of itself.
